# Local-communities-search-from-Twitter-lists

Source code of the algorithms presented in the article "Local communities search from Twitter lists". Algorithms are separated in different folders:
  - algoEnu for ExhaustiveSearch
  - maximal_sampling for MaximalSampling [1]
  - closed_maximal_sampling for ClosedMaximalSampling
  - two_step for DirectSampling [2]
  
Access to the datasets can be provided under request, contact me.
